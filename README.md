A new lightweight javascript Cassowary constraint solver built for speed.

Mooruk is a lightweight and fast cassowary constraint solver based on the [Kiwi C++ implementation](https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi).
A mooruk is a small(er) species of Cassowary noted for its agility in running and leaping.
Mooruk is about 3x faster and 4x smaller compared to [Cassowary.js](https://github.com/slightlyoff/cassowary.js/). It is built for speed and low memory consumption. It contains no syntactical sugar whatsoever and intends to be as lean and mean as possible.
